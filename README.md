# SMS Spam Detection

## Overview
SMS Spam Detection is a machine learning model that takes an SMS message as input and predicts whether it is spam or not. The model is built using Python and deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

## Project Description

- The dataset contains over 5,500 SMS messages labeled as spam or not spam.  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing include handling null and duplicate values, label encoding, tokenization, removing special characters, stop words, punctuation, and stemming.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset, including character, word, and sentence counts, correlations, and visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and word clouds.  
- Multiple classification models are trained and evaluated, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, ExtraTreesClassifier, and SVC. The best model achieved 100% precision.  
- The model is deployed on the web using Streamlit, providing a simple user interface for SMS spam prediction.
